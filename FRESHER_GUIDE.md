## 🎯 How It Works

### Automatic Detection

```javascript
You are detected as a FRESHER if:
- Experience = 0 or 1 years
  OR
- Graduation year = 2024, 2025, or 2026
```

### Enhanced Search Process

**For Freshers (0-1 years experience):**

```
1. System detects you're a fresher
   ↓
2. Builds 3 optimized search queries:
   
   Query 1: Direct Entry-Level
   "software engineer OR entry level software engineer OR 
    junior software engineer (Python OR JavaScript) Remote 
    (Google OR Amazon OR Microsoft OR NVIDIA OR Adobe)"
   
   Query 2: Fresher Keywords
   "fresher OR graduate OR trainee OR associate software 
    (Python OR JavaScript) Remote 
    (Google OR Amazon OR Microsoft OR NVIDIA OR Adobe)"
   
   Query 3: Campus & Intern (if graduation >= 2024)
   "intern OR internship OR campus OR new graduate software 
    (Python OR JavaScript) Remote 
    (Google OR Amazon OR Microsoft OR NVIDIA OR Adobe)"
   ↓
3. Executes all 3 queries in parallel
   ↓
4. Fetches 2 pages per query (more results)
   ↓
5. Searches last month (vs 1 week for experienced)
   ↓
6. Merges all results
   ↓
7. Removes duplicates
   ↓
8. Shows up to 30 jobs (vs 15 for experienced)
```

**For Experienced (2+ years):**
- Standard single-query search
- 15 results max
- Last week only
- 1 page

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Detection Logic

```javascript
function checkIfFresher() {
  if (!userProfile) return false;
  
  const { experience, graduation } = userProfile;
  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
  
  // Check 1: Low experience
  if (experience !== undefined && experience <= 1) {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Check 2: Recent graduation
  if (graduation >= 2024 && graduation <= currentYear + 1) {
    return true;
  }
  
  return false;
}
```

### Query Building

```javascript
buildFresherQueries() {
  // Query 1: Direct entry-level
  "(software engineer OR entry level software engineer OR 
    junior software engineer) (Python OR JavaScript) Remote 
    (Companies)"
  
  // Query 2: Fresher keywords
  "(fresher OR graduate OR trainee OR associate) software 
    (Python OR JavaScript) Remote (Companies)"
  
  // Query 3: Campus/intern (if very fresh)
  "(intern OR internship OR campus OR new graduate) software 
    (Python OR JavaScript) Remote (Companies)"
}
```

### Parallel Execution

```javascript
// Fetch all queries simultaneously
const allJobsArrays = await Promise.all(
  queries.map(query => executeSingleSearch(query, true))
);

// Merge results
const allJobs = allJobsArrays.flat();

// Remove duplicates
const uniqueJobs = deduplicateJobs(allJobs);
```

### Deduplication

```javascript
function deduplicateJobs(jobs) {
  const seen = new Set();
  const unique = [];
  
  for (const job of jobs) {
    // Use job_id or title+company as unique key
    const key = job.id || 
      `${job.title.toLowerCase()}-${job.company.toLowerCase()}`;
    
    if (!seen.has(key)) {
      seen.add(key);
      unique.push(job);
    }
  }
  
  return unique;
}
```

## 🎓 Fresher-Specific Tips

### Profile Optimization

**1. Job Role**
- ✅ "Software Engineer" (not "Senior Software Engineer")
- ✅ "Data Analyst" (not "Data Scientist")
- ✅ "Frontend Developer" (not "Lead Frontend Developer")

**2. Skills**
- List academic/bootcamp skills
- Include project technologies
- Example: "Python, Django, React, SQL, Git"

**3. Experience**
- Set to 0 if fresh graduate
- Set to 1 if 1 internship
- Don't inflate

**4. Graduation**
- Use actual year (2024, 2025, 2026)
- Triggers campus hiring keywords

**5. Location**
- Consider "Remote" for more opportunities
- Or leave blank for all locations

### Search Strategy

**Daily Routine:**
1. Open extension once per day
2. Click "Fetch Personalized Jobs"
3. Browse 20-30 results
4. Apply to 3-5 best matches
5. Repeat next day

**Weekly Updates:**
1. Update skills as you learn
2. Adjust job role if pivot
3. Check for new opportunities

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Getting Few Results

**Check:**
1. Profile has experience = 0 or 1
2. Graduation year = 2024-2026
3. Console shows "👨‍🎓 Fresher detected"
4. Console shows 3 search queries

**Solutions:**
- Update profile to accurate values
- Check API key is valid
- Try removing location filter
- Broaden skills list

### Issue: Too Many Irrelevant Results

**Cause:** Very broad search terms

**Solutions:**
- Make job role more specific
- Add more relevant skills
- Use location filter
- Remove generic roles from profile

### Issue: Duplicate Jobs Appearing

**This shouldn't happen** - deduplication is automatic

**If it does:**
- Check console for errors
- Try reloading extension
- Clear cache and retry
