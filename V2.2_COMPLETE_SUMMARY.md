## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Profile Data Structure

```javascript
{
  jobRole: "Software Engineer",
  skills: "Python, JavaScript, React",
  experience: 2,
  graduation: 2022,
  location: "Remote"
}
```

### Storage Architecture

```javascript
chrome.storage.local = {
  userProfile: {...},      // User's profile
  lastFetchedJobs: [...],  // Cached jobs
  lastFetchTime: 1234567890 // Cache timestamp
}
```

### Query Building Algorithm

```javascript
function buildSearchQuery() {
  if (!userProfile) return defaultQuery;
  
  let parts = [];
  
  // 1. Job role
  parts.push(userProfile.jobRole);
  
  // 2. Skills (OR logic)
  const skills = userProfile.skills.split(',')
    .map(s => s.trim())
    .filter(s => s);
  if (skills.length > 0) {
    parts.push(`(${skills.join(' OR ')})`);
  }
  
  // 3. Experience level
  const exp = userProfile.experience;
  if (exp === 0) {
    parts.push('entry level OR junior OR intern');
  } else if (exp <= 2) {
    parts.push('junior OR entry level');
  } else if (exp <= 5) {
    parts.push('mid-level OR intermediate');
  } else {
    parts.push('senior OR lead');
  }
  
  // 4. Location (optional)
  if (userProfile.location) {
    parts.push(userProfile.location);
  }
  
  // 5. Target companies
  parts.push('(Google OR Amazon OR Microsoft OR NVIDIA OR Adobe)');
  
  return parts.join(' ');
}
```

### Async Operations

All storage operations use async/await:

```javascript
// Save profile
async function saveProfile(profile) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    chrome.storage.local.set({ userProfile: profile }, () => {
      chrome.runtime.lastError ? reject() : resolve();
    });
  });
}

// Load profile
async function loadProfile() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    chrome.storage.local.get(['userProfile'], (result) => {
      chrome.runtime.lastError ? reject() : resolve(result.userProfile);
    });
  });
}
```

**Debug:**
```javascript
// Check permissions
chrome.storage.local.get(console.log)

// Manual save test
chrome.storage.local.set({
  userProfile: {
    jobRole: "Test",
    skills: "Test",
    experience: 1,
    graduation: 2020,
    location: ""
  }
}, () => console.log('Saved!'));
```

---

### Issue 2: Jobs Not Personalized

**Symptoms:**
- Results seem generic
- No mention of your skills
- Wrong experience level

**Solutions:**
1. Check console for search query

3. Make sure profile saved properly
4. Try editing and re-saving profile

**Debug:**
```javascript
// View current profile
chrome.storage.local.get(['userProfile'], console.log)

// Check what query is generated
// Look in console when clicking "Fetch Jobs"
// Should show: "Search query: [your personalized query]"
```

---

### Issue 3: Form Validation Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Cannot submit form
- Fields highlighted in red
- No error message shown

**Solutions:**
1. Check all required fields (*) are filled
