# Quick Setup Guide - JobFinder AI Chrome Extension

## Step 1: Create Icon Files

The extension needs three icon files. You have several options:

### Option A: Use Online Icon Generator (Easiest)
1. Visit https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Upload any image or create a simple design
3. Download the generated icons
4. Rename them to: `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`
5. Place them in the `JustApply` folder

### Option B: Use Python Script (If you have Python installed)
1. Install Pillow: `pip install pillow`
2. Run: `python create_icons.py`
3. Icons will be created automatically

### Option C: Download Free Icons
1. Visit https://icons8.com/ or https://www.flaticon.com/
2. Search for "briefcase" or "job" icons
3. Download in 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 sizes
4. Rename and place in `JustApply` folder

### Option D: Quick Temporary Fix
For testing purposes only, you can temporarily remove icon references:

1. Open `manifest.json`
2. Comment out or remove the `"icons"` and `"default_icon"` sections
3. The extension will work but won't have custom icons
