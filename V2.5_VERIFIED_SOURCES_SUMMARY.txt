🎯 HOW IT WORKS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: FETCH JOBS
   API returns all job listings → 100 jobs

STEP 2: EXTRACT DOMAIN
   For each job, extract domain from apply link
   Example: "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/..." → "linkedin.com"

STEP 3: VERIFY SOURCE
   Check if domain is in TRUSTED_DOMAINS list
   Match exact domain or subdomains
   Example: "careers.google.com" matches "google.com" ✓

STEP 4: FILTER
   Keep only verified jobs → 45 verified jobs
   Log: "✅ Verified jobs: 45 out of 100 total"

STEP 5: DISPLAY
   Show verified jobs with "✓ Verified" badges
   Display info banner at top
