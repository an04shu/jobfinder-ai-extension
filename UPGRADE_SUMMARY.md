## 💡 Pro Tips

### Optimize Your Searches
1. **Be specific**: "senior software engineer" vs "software engineer"
2. **Use location**: Add city names to narrow results
3. **Try different dates**: 'month' shows more jobs than 'week'
4. **Experiment**: Test different job titles and companies

### Save API Requests
1. **Don't over-refresh**: Jobs don't change every minute
2. **Use bookmarks**: Save jobs you're interested in externally
3. **Check once daily**: Most companies post jobs weekly

### Get Better Results
1. **Update regularly**: Check every few days for new postings
2. **Try synonyms**: "engineer" vs "developer" vs "programmer"
3. **Cast wide net**: Include more companies in search
4. **Filter later**: Better to fetch more, then filter visually
